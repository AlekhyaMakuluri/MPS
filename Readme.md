<h1> Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Self-Supervised Vision Transformers on Fundus and OCT Imaging </h1>
<p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness, and early and precise diagnosis is essential for successful treatment. Deep learning algorithms can significantly enhance disease onset analysis and diagnostic performance. Yet, the cross-modality generalizability of current deep learning models across different imaging modalities, including fundus and OCT/OCTA images, is still an issue. In addition, most models lack strong severity staging and efficient feature extraction, limiting clinical applicability. This work presents a deep model that integrates Swin Transformer, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and contrastive learning to facilitate DR detection across different image modalities. A combination of self-supervised learning (SSL) is employed, where SimCLR is used to learn image features from fundus images, DINO for fine-grained segmentation and severity grading, and MoCo for massive OCT/OCTA training. Besides, GNNs are employed to learn spatial and relational dependencies in retinal structures to increase interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. The combination of SSL, Swin Transformer, and GNN improves clinically relevant feature extraction, improves disease severity staging, and improves model generalizability. Compared to conventional deep learning models, our approach offers greater diagnostic accuracy, presents an interpretable and scalable solution for DR detection, and offers deeper understanding of disease progression, ultimately leading to early diagnosis and best treatment planning.</p>
